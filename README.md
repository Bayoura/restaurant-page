`currentTarget` I was so glad when I found this. I used it for the logo-container, which holds the logo name and the logo img. While `target` gives you the element you clicked on 
"The currentTarget property always refers to the element whose event listener triggered the event, opposed to the target property, which returns the element that triggered the event."
